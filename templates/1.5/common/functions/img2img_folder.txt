[template name="img2img folder"]
This template runs an img2img operation on every file inside the specified folder, referencing the filename in each prompt.

The folder path is parsed with glob, so it should end with `/*.*` if you want to process an entire directory.

**Note**: due to a limitation in the extension, you will need to load an initial image before using this. The initial image will be disregarded by the function.
