In a batch run, you can have the 'choose' shortcode pick an option that corresponds to the index of the run.

Normally, if you generate say 5 images at once, 'choose' may randomly select the same option multiple times - which could be undesirable.

Override the random behavior with '_case' and 'batch_index' as shown below and you will get a unique choice for all 5 images.
