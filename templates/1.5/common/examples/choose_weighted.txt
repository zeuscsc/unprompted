A 'choose' shortcode can have options that are more likely to appear than other options.

This is made possible with the 'repeat' shortcode.

Remember to include the _sep argument in 'repeat' to format the output in the way 'choose' expects.

Bonus: the 'repeat' shortcode even supports floats! For example, if you 'repeat 4.4' then there's a 40% chance you'll get 5 outputs instead of 4.

You can use a value between 0 and 1 for a chance to skip the 'repeat' content completely. For example, 'repeat 0.2' will have an 80% chance of discarding its content. That said, if you know your repeat value is always going to be less than 1, just use 'chance' instead!
